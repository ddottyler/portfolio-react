# Portfolio

## Project in action

<img src="./myportfolio/public/videos/demo.gif" />

## Project Overview

This project is a personal portfolio that I created to showcase some of my projects. It was built using JavaScript and React JS.

This project allowed me to improve my skills in ReactJS and was also especially helpful for me to improve in CSS.

## Visiting the website

This React app has been published through GitHub Pages and can be visited [here](https://ddottyler.github.io/portfolio-react/).

## How to start the project from the command line

Clone this repo

```sh
cd portfolio-website
```

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
yarn start
```

## What next for this project?

There are more features that I will be adding to the portfolio soon including:

- A CV Page
- Individual project pages
- I will be adding an API to the project, just need to decide which one first!
- And, of course, more projects!
